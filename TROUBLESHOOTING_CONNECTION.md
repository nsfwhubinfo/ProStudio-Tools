# Troubleshooting Connection to DevPrompt Studio

## Server Status: âœ… RUNNING

The Next.js server is confirmed running on port 3001 and responding correctly.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Your Browser
Try these URLs in order:
- http://localhost:3001
- http://127.0.0.1:3001
- http://[::1]:3001 (IPv6)

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Try a different browser

### 3. Check Firewall/Security Software
- Temporarily disable Windows Defender or other firewall
- Check if any antivirus is blocking localhost connections
- Ensure no VPN is interfering

### 4. WSL-Specific Issues (if using WSL)
If you're accessing from Windows while the server runs in WSL:

```bash
# Get WSL IP address
hostname -I
```

Then access via: http://[WSL-IP]:3001

### 5. Port Forwarding (WSL)
You might need to forward the port from WSL to Windows:

```powershell
# Run in Windows PowerShell as Administrator
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3001 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3001 connectaddress=$(wsl hostname -I)
```

### 6. Alternative Access Methods

#### Using curl (confirmed working):
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001
```

#### Using a different port:
```bash
# Kill current process
pkill -f "next dev"

# Start on a different port
cd ~/prostudio/devprompt-studio
PORT=8080 npm run dev
```

Then access: http://localhost:8080

### 7. Check Network Configuration
```bash
# Check if localhost resolves correctly
ping -c 1 localhost

# Check hosts file
cat /etc/hosts | grep localhost
```

### 8. Direct Network Access
The server is also listening on: http://10.255.255.254:3001

## What You Should See

When successfully connected, you'll see:
- DevPrompt Content Studio title with spectrum glow animation
- Consciousness orb animation
- "Sign in to Continue" button
- Dark theme with glassmorphic elements

## Quick Test

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3001 | grep "DevPrompt Content Studio"
```

If this returns the title, the server is working correctly and the issue is with your browser/network configuration.
