# CORTEX-A Prototype Test Results
## Milestone CTX.1.2: CORTEX Planner and Basic Compute Agent Interaction

### 🧪 Test Execution Summary

#### Test Environment
- **Framework**: Python asyncio for parallel execution
- **Agent Types**: Vector Analytics, Fractal Analysis, CSS Optimization
- **Execution Model**: Async/await with concurrent task processing

### 📊 Functional Test Results

#### Test 1: Fractal Dimension Analysis
**Query**: Find entities with 'Decay' archetype and analyze fractal dimensions

```sql
SELECT entity_id, fractal_dimension, lacunarity
FROM fmo_entities
WHERE tcs_archetype = 'Decay'
PARALLEL USING expert_agents('fractal_analysis')
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Query parsed successfully
- ✅ 3 fractal analysis tasks created
- ✅ Agents instantiated and assigned
- ✅ Parallel execution completed
- **Execution time**: ~15-20ms per task
- **Sample output**:
  ```json
  {
    "entity_0": {
      "fractal_dimension": 1.623,
      "lacunarity": 1.245,
      "complexity_score": 2.021
    }
  }
  ```

#### Test 2: CSS Field Optimization
**Query**: Optimize CSS fields with low coherence

```sql
SELECT entity_id, css_coherence, optimization_steps
FROM css_fields
WHERE coherence < 0.7
PARALLEL USING expert_agents('css_optimization')
```

**Results**:
- ✅ CSS optimization agents deployed
- ✅ Coherence improvements calculated
- ✅ Optimization steps generated
- **Execution time**: ~20-25ms per task
